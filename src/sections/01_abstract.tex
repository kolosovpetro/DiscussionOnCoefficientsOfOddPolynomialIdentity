In this manuscript we revisit an unexpected identity for odd powers, discussed
in~\cite{unusual_identity_for_odd_powers}.
For non-negative integers $n$ and $m$
\[
    n^{2m+1} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \sum_{r=0}^{m} \mathbf{A}_{m,r} k^r (n-k)^r
\]
where $\mathbf{A}_{m,r}$ are rational coefficients.
These coefficients are evaluated by solving a system of linear equations.
However, for arbitrary integer $m\geq 0$ it might be slightly complicated
to build and solve such system of linear equations,
especially for large value of $m$.
Thus, this manuscript addresses this problem by providing a recurrence formula for coefficients $\coeffA{m}{r}$,
which allows computation with ease.
