We study an identity expressing odd powers $n^{2m+1}$ as a double sum of the form
\begin{align*}
    n^{2m+1} = \sum_{r=0}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{n} \coeffA{m}{r} k^r (n-k)^r
\end{align*}
and focus on determining the real coefficients $\coeffA{m}{r}$.
By utilizing classical tools such as the Binomial theorem and Faulhaberâ€™s formula, we obtain
a recurrence for the coefficients
\begin{align*}
    \coeffA{m}{r}
    = (2r+1) \binom{2r}{r} \sum_{d = 2r+1}^{m} \coeffA{m}{d} \binom{d}{2r+1} \frac{(-1)^{d-1}}{d-r} \bernoulli{2d-2r}
\end{align*}
from which all values $\coeffA{m}{r}$ can be computed.
