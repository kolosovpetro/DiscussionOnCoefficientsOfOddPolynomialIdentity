The author is grateful to Albert Tkaczyk for pointing out to the idea of how to build and solve systems of linear equations to evaluate
the coefficients $\coeffA{m}{r}$.
The author is grateful to Dr. Max Alekseyev (George Washington University) for providing a valuable contribution
of recurrence relation~\eqref{prop:coefficients_a}.
The author is grateful to Markus Scheuer for his elegant and beautiful proof
of lemma~\eqref{lem:piecewise-binomial-identity}.
