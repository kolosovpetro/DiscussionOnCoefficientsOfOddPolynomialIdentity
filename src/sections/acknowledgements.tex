The author expresses his sincere gratitude to Albert Tkaczyk for suggesting the approach of constructing and solving
systems of linear equations to determine the coefficients~$\coeffA{m}{r}$.
The author also wishes to thank Dr.~Max Alekseyev (George Washington University)
for his valuable contribution in formulating the recurrence relation~\eqref{prop:coefficients_a}.
Special thanks are due to Markus Scheuer for providing an elegant and insightful
proof of Lemma~\eqref{lem:piecewise-binomial-identity}.
